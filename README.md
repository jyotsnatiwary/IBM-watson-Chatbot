# IBM-watson-Chatbot

Created an instance of Watson assistant, learnt more about intents, entities and dialog; explored language variation by created a dialog in chinese language.
  * Created intents manually, used some predefined intents and also imported intents and tested.

  * Added context variables and slots to the bot in order to make it more intellegent and retain the information of the user throughout the conversation.
  * Explored The passthrough node technique which can come in handy in complex chatbots and examined How context variables work.
  * Made the bot more user friendly by including conditions like <? Input.text?>
